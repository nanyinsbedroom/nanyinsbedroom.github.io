          <h4>How is this data collected?</h4>
          <p>
            The information is gathered using publicly available, third-party tools in a semi-automated process. Think of it like a periodic "in-game census"â€”a snapshot of the player data that is visible at a specific moment in time. This process is run periodically to keep the stats as up-to-date as possible.

        <p>
          Because of this method, please keep in mind that this dashboard is <strong>not</strong> an official, real-time feed from the game servers and is <strong>not affiliated</strong> with the game developers. It represents a large sample of the player base, but may not be 100% complete.
